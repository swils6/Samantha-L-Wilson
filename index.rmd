\
I am a postdoctoral research fellow under [Dr. Michael Hoffman](https://hoffmanlab.org/) at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre within the University Health Network (UHN). I previously completed my PhD in Medical Genetics at the University of British Columbia under Dr. Wendy Robinson.

I am interested in omics data to understand the etiology of pregnancy and fetal pathologies and use that data to develop predictive models. Currently, I am working with bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to analyze DNA methylation data to give insights into pathogenesis and develop predictive signatures of preterm birth. I am using these data to build predictive signatures that will be usable in the clinical setting. 

I am interested in integrating omics data in many types of pregnancy complications to increase our understanding of placental development through gestation, understand how pregnancy complications arise, how each of these complications relate to each other and the heterogeneity present within each clinical class of complication.

**Science Expert**, The Science Pawdcast

February 2020

The Science Pawdcast is an online podcast run by high school chemistry teacher, Jason Zackowski, featuring his twitter science dog, Bunsen the Bernese mountain dog. The podcast aims to make science accessible and engaging to the public. I was interviewed as a science expert in [episode 3 of season 2](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5mlKh99cxkV4T6HYvzBZp5).
